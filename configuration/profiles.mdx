Your profile is a collection of your stories, along with some basic biographical information.

## Profile Fields

You can set these fields using the CLI:

```bash
repr profile set-bio "Backend developer @ Acme"
repr profile set-location "New York"
repr profile set-available true
```

## Exporting Profiles

You can export your entire profile (including all stories) to different formats. This is useful for:
- Creating a backup
- Generating a resume
- sending a report to a manager

```bash
# Markdown
repr profile export --format md > profile.md

# JSON (Raw data)
repr profile export --format json > profile.json
```

## Public Profile

If you choose to publish, your profile will be hosted at `https://repr.dev/@yourusername`.
