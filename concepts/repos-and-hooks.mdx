## Repositories

Repr needs to know which folders to watch. You "track" a repository by adding it to repr's configuration.

- **Discovery**: `repr init` automatically finds git repos in a directory.
- **Manual Add**: `repr repos add ~/path/to/repo` adds a specific repo.

## Git Hooks

To make tracking automatic, repr can install a `post-commit` hook in your repositories.

### How it works
1. You run `git commit`.
2. The hook triggers `repr hooks queue <sha>`.
3. The commit SHA is added to a local queue file in `~/.repr/queues/`.
4. The hook finishes instantly (no network calls, no LLM processing).

### Processing the Queue
When you later run `repr generate`, repr checks the queue and processes all pending commits into stories.

### Managing Hooks
- **Install**: `repr hooks install --all`
- **Remove**: `repr hooks remove --all`
- **Check**: `repr hooks status`
