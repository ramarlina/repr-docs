Repr is built on a **Local-First** architecture. This means your data lives on your machine by default, and you have complete control over when (and if) it leaves.

## Data Boundaries

| Data Type | Local Storage | Cloud Storage | Condition |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Source Code** | Yes (in your repos) | **Never** | Repr never uploads your code. |
| **Commit Diffs** | Yes (temporary analysis) | **Never*** | Only sent to LLM for processing, then discarded. |
| **Stories** | Yes (`~/.repr/stories`) | Optional | Only if you run `repr push`. |
| **Profile** | Yes (`~/.repr/config`) | Optional | Only if you run `repr push`. |
| **API Keys** | Yes (OS Keychain) | **Never** | Keys never leave your device. |

<Note>
*If you use `repr generate --cloud`, diffs are sent to repr's stateless processing pipeline. They are not stored. If you use `--local`, diffs never leave your machine.
</Note>
