**repr** is a local-first developer tool that reads your git commits and turns them into professional narratives. Think of it as a personal archivist for your work—automatically capturing what you build, so you never have to remember (or recreate) your accomplishments.

    Use local LLMs (Ollama) or your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc). Your choice.

## Real Developers, Real Results

### "I used repr to prep for my Meta interview in 30 minutes"

> I had a final round coming up. They always ask 'tell me about a time you solved a complex problem.' I knew I had good examples buried in my git history, but I couldn't remember specifics.
>
> Ran `repr generate --template interview` and got 8 perfect STAR-format stories with actual metrics from my code. Featured my top 3, exported to markdown, reviewed them the morning of my interview. Nailed every behavioral question.
>
> **— Sarah, Senior Backend Engineer**

### "Our sprint demos went from chaos to polished in 5 minutes"

> Every two weeks, our PM would ask 'what did the team ship?' and we'd scramble to remember. Now I just run `repr commits --days 14` on Friday afternoon and export it as our sprint summary.
>
> Added/Changed/Fixed format. Real commit data. No one has to remember what they did. Our stakeholders love it.
>
> **— Marcus, Engineering Manager**

### "I run repr in a fully air-gapped environment"

> Work in defense. Code can't leave the building. Set up repr with Ollama, locked to local-only mode. Now I can still generate stories for my annual review without ever touching the network.
>
> Privacy audit shows zero external calls. It's the only tool I trust for this.
>
> **— Alex, Security Engineer**

### "My weekly 1-on-1s with my manager are 10x better"

> I used to show up with vague 'I worked on some bug fixes.' Now I run `repr commits --days 7` before every 1-on-1. I have specific examples of what I shipped, with context.
>
> My manager started using my exports for *her* updates to her boss. Got promoted 6 months later.
>
> **— Jamie, Frontend Developer**

## How It Works

1. **Scan your repos** — Point repr at your code directory
2. **Install hooks (optional)** — Auto-capture commits as you work
3. **Generate stories** — LLM reads your commits and creates narratives
4. **Review and curate** — Polish, feature, or hide stories as needed
5. **(Optional) Publish** — Share your profile on repr.dev or keep it private

Everything happens locally by default. You control what (if anything) gets shared.

```bash
# First-time setup
repr init ~/code
repr generate --local
repr dashboard                    # Explore stories in web UI

# Daily use (rp = repr)
rp commits --days 3               # Last 3 days (standup)
rp commits --days 7               # Last 7 days (week)
rp generate --local               # Turn commits into stories

# Interview prep
rp generate --template interview
rp story feature <id>             # Pin your best work
