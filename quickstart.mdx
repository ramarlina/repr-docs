Follow these steps to generate your first stories from your existing git history.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install repr">
    Install using Homebrew (macOS/Linux) or pipx (Universal).

    ```bash
    brew tap repr-app/tap
    brew install repr
    ```

    <Note>See [Installation](/installation) for Windows and other methods.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize">
    Scan your code directory to find repositories. Repr works best when you point it at a folder containing multiple projects.

    ```bash
    repr init ~/code
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Stories">
    Generate summaries for your recent work. By default, this uses your local LLM (if available) or prompts for an API key.

    ```bash
    repr generate --local
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Results">
    See the stories you just created.

    ```bash
    repr stories              # List in terminal
    repr dashboard            # Open web UI (recommended)
    ```

    <Tip>Use `rp` as a shorthand for `repr` — e.g., `rp dashboard`, `rp stories`.</Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>
