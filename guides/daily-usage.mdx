Here's the thing about tracking your work: if it takes more than 5 seconds, you won't do it. You're busy shipping code, not maintaining a work journal.

Repr solves this by making tracking **invisible**. Once you set it up, it just works in the background. Here are three ways to fit repr into your daily flow, from fully automatic to totally manual.

## Option 1: Set It and Forget It (Recommended)

Install git hooks once. From then on, every commit you make gets silently queued for story generation—no interruptions, no network calls, just quiet tracking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install hooks everywhere">
    One command to install hooks in all your tracked repos:

    ```bash
    repr hooks install --all
    ```

    That's it. Now when you run `git commit`, repr adds that commit to a local queue in the background. You won't even notice it happening.

    **What gets sent where?** Nothing. The hook just writes to `~/.repr/queue` on your machine. No network activity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate stories when you're ready">
    At the end of your day (or week, or whenever), turn the queue into stories:

    ```bash
    repr generate --local
    ```

    Repr reads the queued commits, groups related work, and generates professional summaries using your local LLM.

    ```text
    Processing 23 queued commits...
    
    myproject (12 commits) → 3 stories
      • Built OAuth2 integration with Google and GitHub providers
      • Implemented Redis caching for session management  
      • Fixed race condition in authentication flow
    
    frontend-app (11 commits) → 2 stories
      • Redesigned settings page with improved UX flows
      • Added dark mode toggle with system preference detection
    
    ✓ Generated 5 stories
    ✓ Cleared queue
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and approve">
    New stories are marked as "needs review" by default. Check them out:

    ```bash
    repr stories --needs-review
    ```

    Or use the interactive review flow:

    ```bash
    repr review
    ```

    You'll be walked through each story with options:

    ```text
    Story 1/5: Built OAuth2 integration with Google/GitHub

    OAuth2 integration supporting Google and GitHub providers with 
    PKCE flow for enhanced security. Implemented token refresh logic
    and proper error handling for expired credentials.
    
    Technologies: Python, OAuth2, Redis
    
    [a] Approve  [e] Edit  [r] Regenerate  [d] Delete  [s] Skip  [q] Quit
    ```

    Press `a` to approve, `e` to edit in your `$EDITOR`, or `r` to regenerate with different context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Run `repr generate` on Friday afternoons. Review your week's work in 2 minutes, then export it as your weekly update for your manager or team.
</Tip>

## Option 2: Quick Morning Standup

Don't want hooks? No problem. Use repr as your standup prep tool.

```bash
repr commits --days 3
```

This gives you a quick summary of the last 3 days—perfect for answering "what did you work on yesterday?"

```text
Commits (last 3 days) — 17 total

myproject:
  abc1234  Add user authentication flow           • 2 days ago
  def5678  Fix session timeout bug                • 2 days ago
  ghi9012  Implement rate limiting middleware     • yesterday
  jkl3456  Update API documentation               • today
  
frontend-app:
  mno7890  Add loading states to forms            • yesterday
  pqr1234  Fix responsive layout on mobile        • today
```

Want to generate stories from these commits?

```bash
repr generate --days 3 --local
```

Now they're permanent stories in your `~/.repr/stories` folder.

## Option 3: End-of-Day Capture

Maybe you don't want automatic hooks, but you do want to capture your work at the end of each day. That's the sweet spot for a lot of people.

```bash
# See what you did today
repr commits --since "this morning"
```

Output:
```text
Commits (since this morning) — 8 total

myproject:
  abc1234  Implement password reset flow    • 4 hours ago
  def5678  Add email verification           • 3 hours ago
  ghi9012  Fix CORS headers for production  • 1 hour ago
  
frontend-app:
  jkl3456  Update user profile UI           • 2 hours ago
  mno7890  Add avatar upload                • 30 minutes ago
```

Like what you see? Generate stories from them:

```bash
repr generate --since "this morning" --local
```

Or get even more specific:

```bash
# Work since Monday
repr generate --since "monday" --local

# Just this week
repr generate --days 7 --local

# Specific date range
repr generate --since "2026-01-01" --local
```

## Which Workflow Should You Use?

Here's how to think about it:

| Workflow | Best For | Time Investment |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Hooks (automatic)** | People who want zero friction | 1 min setup, then nothing |
| **Morning review** | People who like morning rituals | 30 seconds daily |
| **End-of-day** | People who batch work at day's end | 2 minutes daily |

The honest truth? Most people start with `repr commits --days 3`, realize they want it automated, and switch to hooks. But all three work great—pick what fits your style.

## What Happens Next?

Once you've got stories being generated regularly, you can:

- **Weekly review**: Use [Weekly Reflection](/guides/weekly-reflection) to curate and polish your best work
- **Interview prep**: Generate [STAR-format stories](/guides/interview-prep) for behavioral interviews
- **Publishing**: (Optional) [Share your profile](/guides/publishing) on repr.dev

The key is: **start capturing now**. Future you will thank present you when it's time to update your resume, prep for a review, or answer "what have you been working on?"
