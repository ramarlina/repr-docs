It's Friday at 4pm. Your manager Slacks you: "Hey, can you send me a quick summary of what you shipped this week?"

You *know* you were productive. You merged like 15 PRs. But trying to remember what they were about? That's a different story.

Enter the weekly reflection workflow. Spend 5 minutes every Friday reviewing your week, polishing your stories, and exporting a summary. Your future self (and your manager) will thank you.

## The Friday Afternoon Ritual

<Steps>
  <Step title="See the week at a glance">
    First, get the high-level view:

    ```bash
    repr commits --days 7
    ```

    You'll see a clean summary of your commits grouped by repo:

    ```text
    📊 Last 7 days across 3 repositories (42 commits)

    myproject (23 commits):
      • OAuth2 integration with Google/GitHub
      • Redis caching implementation
      • Auth flow race condition fix
      • API rate limiting
      • Documentation updates
    
    frontend-app (15 commits):
      • Settings page redesign
      • Dark mode implementation
      • Form validation improvements
    
    docs-site (4 commits):
      • API reference updates
      • Getting started guide
    
    Total: 42 commits, 87 files changed
    ```

    Not bad for a week.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Turn it into stories">
    Now generate professional narratives from those commits:

    ```bash
    repr generate --local --batch-size 10
    ```

    The `--batch-size 10` tells repr to look at commits in groups of 10 (instead of the default 5). This helps it see patterns across multiple PRs.

    ```text
    Generating stories (local LLM: llama3.2)...
    
    Processing 42 commits in batches of 10...
    
    myproject → 4 stories
      • Built OAuth2 integration with Google and GitHub providers
      • Implemented Redis caching layer for session management
      • Fixed race condition in authentication flow
      • Added comprehensive API rate limiting
    
    frontend-app → 2 stories  
      • Redesigned settings page with improved UX
      • Implemented dark mode with system preference detection
    
    docs-site → 1 story
      • Updated API documentation and onboarding guides
    
    ✓ Generated 7 stories
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Polish and curate">
    The LLM did good work, but you can make it even better. Add context that isn't obvious from the code.

    ```bash
    # See what got generated
    repr stories
    ```

    Pick a story to improve:

    ```bash
    repr story edit 01ARYZ6S41TSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
    ```

    This opens the story in your `$EDITOR` (vim, nano, VS Code—whatever you have configured). Add details like:
    - **Why** you built this (the business context)
    - **Impact** on users or metrics  
    - **Challenges** you overcame that don't show up in commit messages

    Example of what you might add:
    ```markdown
    Built OAuth2 integration with Google and GitHub providers
    
    Implemented OAuth2 authentication supporting Google and GitHub 
    sign-in, replacing our legacy username/password system. Used PKCE 
    flow for enhanced security and proper token refresh handling.
    
    **Impact:** Reduced signup friction by 40%, increased conversions
    from 12% to 17%. Users can now sign in with existing accounts 
    instead of creating yet another password.
    
    **Technical challenges:** Handled edge cases around expired tokens
    and implemented graceful fallback when providers are unavailable.
    ```

    Save and close. That's now part of your permanent story.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Feature your best work">
    Some stories are just better than others. Mark them so they appear at the top of your profile:

    ```bash
    repr story feature 01ARYZ6S41TSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
    ```

    Featured stories show up first when you export or publish your profile.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export and share">
    Now for the payoff. Generate a beautiful markdown summary:

    ```bash
    repr profile export --format md --since "1 week ago" > weekly-summary.md
    ```

    Open `weekly-summary.md` and you've got a polished update ready to share with your team, your manager, or just keep for your own records.

    Want JSON instead (for feeding into other tools)?

    ```bash
    repr profile export --format json --since "1 week ago" > week.json
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pro Tips for Better Stories

### Use the Right Template

Different audiences need different styles. Repr has templates for that:

| Template | Best For | Output Style | When to Use |
|----------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `resume` | Portfolios, resumes | Action verbs, quantified impact | Job searching, annual reviews |
| `changelog` | Release notes, tech teams | Added/Changed/Fixed categories | Sprint reviews, release notes |
| `narrative` | Blog posts, case studies | Storytelling, problem-solving | Blog content, detailed writeups |
| `interview` | Job interviews | STAR format (Situation/Task/Action/Result) | Interview prep |

**Examples:**

```bash
# For your manager (impact-focused)
repr generate --template resume

# For release notes (technical)
repr generate --template changelog

# For a blog post about what you learned
repr generate --template narrative

# For interview prep
repr generate --template interview
```

### The Changelog Style

Perfect for sprint demos or release notes:

```bash
repr generate --template changelog
```

Output:
```markdown
## Added
- OAuth2 authentication with Google/GitHub providers
- Dark mode support with system preference detection
- Comprehensive API rate limiting

## Fixed  
- Race condition in authentication flow causing intermittent failures
- Form validation errors not showing on mobile

## Changed
- Settings page redesigned with improved navigation
- Migrated from username/password to OAuth2
```

### The STAR Interview Style

Building a story bank for your next job search:

```bash
repr generate --template interview
```

Output:
```markdown
**Situation:** The authentication system was experiencing race 
conditions under high load, causing 5-10% of login attempts to fail.

**Task:** I needed to identify the root cause and implement a fix 
without disrupting the existing user session management.

**Action:** I traced the issue to concurrent Redis operations during 
session creation. Implemented distributed locking using Redis SETNX 
with proper timeout handling and retry logic.

**Result:** Reduced authentication failures from 8% to <0.1%. 
Improved average login latency by 20ms. No user sessions lost during 
the migration.
```

Copy/paste that directly into your interview notes.

## Make It a Habit

The magic of weekly reflection isn't in the tool—it's in the **consistency**. Here's how to make it stick:

**Option 1: Calendar Block**  
Put "repr weekly review" on your calendar every Friday at 4pm. Five minutes, every week.

**Option 2: Git Hook (Meta)**  
Some people hook it up to their Friday afternoon commits. When you push your last PR of the week, repr reminds you to review.

**Option 3: Manager 1-on-1s**  
If you have weekly 1-on-1s, run your reflection right before. Export the summary and send it as pre-read. Your manager will love you.

## What This Gets You

After a month of weekly reflections, you'll have:

- **20+ polished stories** about real work you shipped
- **A living portfolio** that updates itself
- **Easy performance reviews** - Just export the last 3 months
- **Interview prep on demand** - Switch to `--template interview` and you're ready
- **Proof of impact** for raises, promotions, or job searches

The compound effect is real. Five minutes a week becomes an incredible career asset over time.
