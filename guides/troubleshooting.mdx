Repr not working? Something feels off? Let's debug it.

This guide covers the most common issues and how to fix them. Start with the health check, then jump to your specific problem.

## The Universal Fix: Run Doctor

When something's wrong, start here:

```bash
repr doctor
```

Output:
```text
Checking repr health...

✓ Config: valid (v3)
✓ Stories: 45 files, no corruption detected
✓ Local LLM: Ollama (llama3.2) - connected
✓ Git: 2.40.0 - found
✓ Tracked repos: 5 repositories
⚠ Repo warning: 1 missing (/old/path/deleted-repo)

Recommendations:
  1. Remove missing repo: repr repos remove /old/path/deleted-repo
  
Overall health: Good (1 warning)
```

This catches 80% of issues. If there's a problem, `repr doctor` tells you how to fix it.

Still broken? Read on.

## Common Issues

### "Local LLM not found"

**Symptoms:**
```text
Error: Cannot connect to local LLM
Tried: http://localhost:11434/v1
Connection refused
```

**Causes:**
- Ollama (or your local LLM) isn't running
- Wrong endpoint configured

**Fix:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check if Ollama is running">
    ```bash
    # Try to reach Ollama
    curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
    ```

    If you get "connection refused", Ollama isn't running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Ollama">
    ```bash
    # macOS/Linux
    ollama serve
    
    # Or if installed via Homebrew, it should auto-start
    brew services start ollama
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull a model if you haven't">
    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3.2
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the connection">
    ```bash
    repr llm test
    ```

    Should show:
    ```text
    ✓ Local LLM: Connected
    ✓ Model: llama3.2
    ✓ Response time: 234ms
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Still broken?**

Maybe your LLM is on a different port:

```bash
# Check what's running
lsof -i :11434

# If it's on a different port, configure repr
repr config set llm.local_api_url http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/v1
repr llm test
```

---

### "Not authenticated" / "Auth token expired"

**Symptoms:**
```text
Error: Not authenticated
Run 'repr login' to sign in
```

Or:
```text
Error: Auth token expired
Please login again
```

**Fix:**

```bash
repr login
```

This opens your browser for re-authentication. Once you sign in, you're good.

**Don't want to use cloud?**

If you're getting auth errors but want local-only mode:

```bash
repr privacy lock-local
```

Now repr won't try to authenticate. It'll only use local features.

---

### "Repository not tracked"

**Symptoms:**
```text
Error: Repository ~/code/my-project not tracked
Run 'repr repos add ~/code/my-project' to track it
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# Add the repo
repr repos add ~/code/my-project

# Or add multiple at once
repr repos add ~/code/project-1 ~/code/project-2

# Or re-scan your code directory
repr init ~/code
```

**Check what's tracked:**

```bash
repr repos list
```

Output:
```text
Tracked Repositories:

✓ ~/code/my-project (active, 143 commits)
✓ ~/code/frontend-app (active, 87 commits)
⚠ ~/code/old-project (missing - directory not found)

Total: 3 tracked (2 active, 1 missing)
```

**Remove repos you don't want:**

```bash
repr repos remove ~/code/old-project
```

---

### "Git hook not working" / "Commits not being queued"

**Symptoms:**

You've installed hooks, but when you commit, nothing happens. `repr hooks status` shows hooks aren't firing.

**Diagnose:**

```bash
repr hooks status
```

Output:
```text
Hook Status:

~/code/my-project:
  post-commit: ✗ Not installed
  
~/code/frontend-app:
  post-commit: ✓ Installed
  Last triggered: Never
```

**Fix:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reinstall hooks">
    ```bash
    repr hooks install --all
    ```

    This re-installs hooks in all tracked repos.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for conflicting hooks">
    Some repos have existing hooks that might conflict:

    ```bash
    ls -la ~/code/my-project/.git/hooks/
    ```

    If you see `post-commit.old` or `post-commit.sample`, there was a pre-existing hook.

    Repr tries to be smart and chain hooks, but occasionally this fails. Manually check `.git/hooks/post-commit` and make sure it includes the repr hook.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test manually">
    Make a commit and check if it queued:

    ```bash
    cd ~/code/my-project
    git commit --allow-empty -m "Test hook"
    
    # Check if it was queued
    repr hooks status
    ```

    Look for "Last triggered" to update.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Still not working?**

The hook might be erroring silently. Check the hook script:

```bash
cat ~/code/my-project/.git/hooks/post-commit
```

You should see something like:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
repr hooks post-commit "$PWD" "$1" || true
```

If that's missing, reinstall:

```bash
repr hooks install --repo ~/code/my-project
```

---

### "Corrupted config"

**Symptoms:**
```text
Error: Config file corrupted or invalid
Location: ~/.repr/config.json
```

**Fix:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Back up your config (just in case)">
    ```bash
    cp ~/.repr/config.json ~/.repr/config.json.backup
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try to view the config">
    ```bash
    cat ~/.repr/config.json
    ```

    If it's valid JSON, you can manually fix it. If it's completely broken, reset it:
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reset config to defaults">
    ```bash
    repr config reset
    ```

    This creates a fresh config file. You'll need to reconfigure:

    ```bash
    repr init ~/code
    repr llm configure
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Restore specific settings:**

If you have a backup, you can merge settings:

```bash
# Edit config manually
repr config edit
```

This opens `~/.repr/config.json` in your `$EDITOR`. Copy settings from your backup.

---

### "Out of disk space" / "Slow performance"

**Symptoms:**

Repr is slow or you're running out of disk space.

**Check storage:**

```bash
repr data
```

Output:
```text
Local Data Storage

Stories: 2.1 MB
Profiles: 340 KB
Cache: 1.2 GB  ← Might be large
Config: 8 KB
Total: 1.5 GB
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# Clear cache (keeps stories and config)
repr data clear-cache
```

This can free up significant space. Repr caches LLM responses and intermediate data. Clearing the cache won't delete your stories.

**Still slow?**

Your local LLM might be underpowered:

```bash
repr llm test
```

If response time is >5 seconds, consider:
- Using a smaller model: `ollama pull phi3` (lighter than llama3.2)
- Using cloud LLM: `repr generate --cloud` (requires login)
- Using BYOK: `repr llm add openai` (your own API key)

---

### "Sync conflicts" / "Can't push to cloud"

**Symptoms:**
```text
Error: Sync conflict detected
Story 01ABC... edited on multiple devices

Or:

Error: Push failed
Server returned 409 Conflict
```

**Diagnose:**

```bash
repr status
```

Shows:
```text
Sync status:
  ⚠ 1 conflict to resolve
  ↓ 2 remote stories newer than local
  ↑ 3 local stories not on remote
```

**Fix:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Force pull (use remote version)">
    ```bash
    repr pull --force
    ```

    This overwrites your local changes with the remote version. Your local edits are backed up to `~/.repr/conflicts/`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Or force push (use local version)">
    ```bash
    repr push --force
    ```

    This overwrites the remote with your local version.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Or manually resolve">
    Check the conflict directory:

    ```bash
    ls ~/.repr/conflicts/
    cat ~/.repr/conflicts/01ABC....json
    ```

    Pick the version you want and manually restore it:

    ```bash
    cp ~/.repr/conflicts/01ABC....json ~/.repr/stories/
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Prevent conflicts:**

Always sync before working:

```bash
repr pull  # Start of session
# ... do work ...
repr push  # End of session
```

### "Stories not generating" / "LLM errors"

**Symptoms:**
```text
Error: Failed to generate stories
LLM returned error: 500 Internal Server Error

Or:

Generating stories...
[Long pause, then timeout]
```

**Diagnose:**

```bash
# Test your LLM connection
repr llm test
```

**Common causes:**

1. **Local LLM crashed**: Restart Ollama
   ```bash
   pkill ollama
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **Model not loaded**: Pull the model again
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```

3. **Out of memory**: Your model is too big for your RAM
   ```bash
   # Try a smaller model
   ollama pull phi3
   repr config set llm.local_model phi3
   ```

4. **API rate limit (BYOK)**: You hit your provider's rate limit
   ```text
   Error: Rate limit exceeded
   ```
   
   Wait a few minutes or switch providers:
   ```bash
   repr llm use byok:anthropic
   ```

---

### "Can't find repr command" / "Command not found"

**Symptoms:**
```bash
$ repr
-bash: repr: command not found
```

**Fix:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check if repr is installed">
    ```bash
    which repr
    ```

    If nothing shows up, repr isn't in your PATH.
  </Step>

  <Step title="If installed via Homebrew">
    ```bash
    brew list repr
    
    # If not found, reinstall
    brew install repr
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="If installed via pipx">
    ```bash
    pipx list | grep repr
    
    # If not found, reinstall
    pipx install repr-cli
    
    # Make sure pipx bin dir is in PATH
    pipx ensurepath
    ```

    Close and reopen your terminal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    ```bash
    repr --version
    ```

    Should show: `repr version 0.2.0` (or similar)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Edge Cases

### repr Works, But Stories Are Bad Quality

Not a bug—this is an LLM problem.

**Fixes:**

1. **Try a different model**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull codellama
   repr config set llm.local_model codellama
   ```

2. **Use a better LLM via BYOK**:
   ```bash
   repr llm add openai
   repr llm use byok:openai
   ```
   OpenAI's models are generally better than open-source local models.

3. **Add context with custom prompts**:
   ```bash
   repr generate --prompt "Focus on user impact and business value"
   ```

4. **Edit stories manually**:
   ```bash
   repr story edit <id>
   ```
   Polish them yourself. Repr gives you the 80% draft, you add the 20% polish.

---

### repr Is Too Slow

**Causes:**
- Local LLM is underpowered
- Processing too many commits at once
- Disk I/O bottleneck

**Fixes:**

```bash
# Use smaller batch size
repr generate --batch-size 3

# Switch to cloud (faster)
repr generate --cloud

# Or use BYOK with a fast provider (Groq is very fast)
repr llm add groq
repr llm use byok:groq
```

---

### "Permission denied" Errors

**Symptoms:**
```text
Error: Permission denied
Cannot write to ~/.repr/stories
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.repr

# Fix if needed
chmod -R u+w ~/.repr
```

If on a corporate machine with restrictive permissions, you might need to:

```bash
# Use a different directory
repr config set storage.path ~/Documents/repr-data
```

---

## Still Stuck?

If none of this helps:

1. **Try a fresh install**:
   ```bash
   # Backup your data first
   repr data backup --output ~/repr-backup.json
   
   # Uninstall
   brew uninstall repr  # or: pipx uninstall repr-cli
   
   # Reinstall
   brew install repr  # or: pipx install repr-cli
   
   # Restore
   repr data restore ~/repr-backup.json
   ```

2. **Ask for help**:
   - GitHub Issues: https://github.com/repr-app/cli/issues
   - Discord: https://repr.dev/discord (if available)
   - Email: support@repr.dev

Include the output of `repr doctor` when asking for help. Makes debugging way easier.
