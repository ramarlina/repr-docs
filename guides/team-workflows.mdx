Repr isn't just for individual developers. It's surprisingly powerful for teams.

Whether you're a tech lead reviewing contributions, an engineering manager preparing for 1-on-1s, or a product team doing sprint retros—repr can help you surface what actually got done.

Here are some team workflows that work really well.

## Sprint Reviews & Demos

You're about to do a sprint demo. Your PM asks: "What did the team ship this sprint?"

Instead of scrambling through Jira tickets or asking everyone to remember their work, use repr to generate a summary.

### The Workflow

```bash
# Track the team's main repos
repr repos add ~/code/team-api
repr repos add ~/code/team-frontend  
repr repos add ~/code/shared-lib

# View commits for the last 2 weeks (one sprint)
repr commits --days 14

# Generate stories with the changelog template for sprint summaries
repr generate --template changelog --since "2 weeks ago"
```

Output:
```text
Generating changelog (last 2 weeks)...

## Added
- OAuth2 authentication with SSO support
- Real-time notification system via WebSockets
- User preference management dashboard
- Comprehensive API rate limiting
- Dark mode throughout application

## Fixed  
- Race condition in session handling (affecting 8% of users)
- Memory leak in WebSocket connections
- Form validation errors on mobile Safari
- Slow query performance in analytics dashboard

## Changed
- Migrated from REST polling to WebSocket subscriptions
- Redesigned settings page with improved UX
- Updated authentication flow for SSO compliance

Total: 87 commits across 3 repositories
23 contributors
```

Copy/paste that into your sprint demo slides. Done.

### Export for Stakeholders

Want a polished document for stakeholders?

```bash
repr profile export --format md --since "2 weeks ago" > sprint-14-summary.md
```

Send that to your PM, your manager, or your stakeholders. They get a readable summary of what the team actually built.

## Engineering Manager 1-on-1s

You're an EM with 6 direct reports. You have 1-on-1s every week. You want to come prepared with specific examples of each person's work.

Repr makes this easy.

### Per-Developer Summaries

```bash
# Track your team's repos
repr repos add ~/code/team-project

# Generate stories (this captures everyone's commits)
repr generate --local

# Export to JSON for analysis
repr profile export --format json > team-work.json
```

Now use `jq` or write a small script to group stories by author:

```bash
# Show work by specific developer
repr commits --author "alice@company.com" --since "1 week ago"
```

Output:
```text
Alice's work (last 7 days):

team-api (8 commits):
  • Implement user preference API endpoints
  • Add caching layer for preference lookups
  • Fix N+1 query in user dashboard
  • Add comprehensive API tests

team-frontend (5 commits):
  • Build preference management UI
  • Integrate with new API endpoints
  • Add loading states and error handling

Total: 13 commits, 23 files changed
```

Bring that to your 1-on-1. You have specifics to discuss instead of vague "how's it going?"

### Preparing for Performance Reviews

It's Q4. Time for annual reviews. You need to write summaries for each team member.

```bash
# Generate 6 months of stories for your repos
repr generate --since "6 months ago" --template resume

# Export to markdown
repr profile export --format md --since "6 months ago" > Q2-Q4-work.md
```

You now have a professional summary of every significant piece of work the team shipped. Break it down by author and you've got the bulk of your review write-ups.

## Sprint Retrospectives

Your team does retros every 2 weeks. You want to reflect on what you built and what went well/poorly.

### Generate Context for the Retro

```bash
# Changelog-style summary for the sprint
repr generate --template changelog --since "2 weeks ago"

# Or narrative style for more context
repr generate --template narrative --since "2 weeks ago"
```

Narrative output:
```markdown
Over the past two weeks, the team focused primarily on authentication 
and user preferences. We started by implementing OAuth2 with SSO 
support, which required coordinating with the infrastructure team for 
certificate management.

The biggest technical challenge was handling race conditions in our 
session management. This manifested as intermittent login failures 
affecting about 8% of users. After extensive debugging with distributed 
tracing, we identified concurrent Redis operations as the culprit and 
implemented distributed locking with proper timeout handling.

We also shipped a complete user preference management system, including 
backend APIs with caching and a polished frontend UI. The team worked 
in parallel—backend and frontend moving together instead of sequential 
handoffs. This significantly reduced cycle time.

Towards the end of the sprint, we tackled several performance issues, 
most notably a slow analytics query that was timing out during peak 
hours. Query optimization reduced response time from 8 seconds to under 
200ms...
```

Read that at the start of your retro. Everyone remembers what actually happened instead of vague feelings.

### Identify Patterns

Looking at multiple sprints helps you spot patterns:

```bash
# Last 3 sprints
repr generate --template changelog --since "6 weeks ago"
```

Look for:
- **Types of work**: Are you always fixing bugs? Shipping features? Dealing with tech debt?
- **Blockers**: Do the stories mention waiting for dependencies?
- **Wins**: What shipped smoothly?

Use this as input for your retro discussions.

## Tech Lead / Architect Review

You're a tech lead or architect. You want to stay aware of what your team is building without micromanaging or reading every PR.

### Weekly Tech Lead Standup

```bash
# Every Monday morning, review last week's work
repr commits --days 7
repr generate --template changelog --days 7
```

Output shows:
- New features added
- Bugs fixed  
- Architecture changes
- Dependencies introduced

Takes 5 minutes to review. You stay in the loop without asking everyone "what are you working on?"

### Spotting Technical Drift

Generate stories monthly and look for patterns:

```bash
repr generate --since "1 month ago" --template resume
repr profile export --format json > monthly-work.json
```

Look for:
- **Technology creep**: Are new libraries/frameworks being added without discussion?
- **Code duplication**: Are multiple people solving the same problem differently?
- **Architecture violations**: Are stories mentioning shortcuts or workarounds?

This gives you data for architectural conversations instead of gut feelings.

## Product Manager Updates

You're a PM. Your stakeholders ask: "What's the engineering team working on?"

### Weekly Stakeholder Update

```bash
# View commits for the week
repr commits --days 7

# Generate stories from this week
repr generate --days 7 --local

# Export as markdown
repr profile export --format md --since "1 week ago" > weekly-update.md
```

Edit the markdown to:
- Remove internal technical details
- Add user impact framing
- Highlight features stakeholders care about

Example transformation:

Before (technical):
```markdown
Implemented Redis caching layer for session management with distributed 
locking and SETNX-based conflict resolution.
```

After (stakeholder-friendly):
```markdown
Improved login reliability from 92% to 99.9%. Users will experience 
fewer "please try again" errors during peak hours.
```

Repr gives you the raw material. You add the product context.

## Changelog Generation for Releases

Your team ships weekly. You need release notes.

```bash
# Generate changelog for last week
repr generate --template changelog --since "1 week ago"

# Export to markdown
repr profile export --format md --since "1 week ago" > CHANGELOG-v2.14.md
```

You get a structured changelog:
- **Added**: New features
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes
- **Changed**: Breaking changes or improvements

Clean it up, add ticket numbers if needed, and publish.

## Team Collaboration Best Practices

### 1. Shared Repo Tracking

Everyone on the team should track the same repos:

```bash
# Share this command with your team
repr repos add ~/code/team-api
repr repos add ~/code/team-frontend
```

Now everyone can generate stories from the same repositories.

### 2. Consistent Templates

Agree on templates for different use cases:

- **Sprint demos**: `--template changelog`
- **Stakeholder updates**: `--template resume`
- **Technical deep-dives**: `--template narrative`
- **Performance reviews**: `--template resume`

This creates consistency across the team.

### 3. Privacy Boundaries

Make sure the team knows:
- Stories are **local by default**
- Publishing is **opt-in**
- Each person controls their own profile

Team leads can use repr for internal summaries without requiring everyone to publish publicly.

### 4. Review Before Sharing

Always preview before sending to stakeholders:

```bash
repr push --dry-run
```

Make sure nothing sensitive is included (internal project names, security details, proprietary algorithms).

## Tools and Scripts for Teams

### Export All Team Work (Bash Script)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as: export-team-work.sh

SINCE=${1:-"1 week ago"}
OUTPUT="team-work-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md"

repr generate --template changelog --since "$SINCE"
repr profile export --format md --since "$SINCE" > "$OUTPUT"

echo "Team summary exported to: $OUTPUT"
```

Usage:
```bash
./export-team-work.sh "2 weeks ago"
```

### Per-Developer Reports (Python Script)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Save as: developer-reports.py

import json
import subprocess
from collections import defaultdict

# Get all stories as JSON
result = subprocess.run(
    ["repr", "profile", "export", "--format", "json"],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True
)

stories = json.loads(result.stdout)

# Group by author (extracted from story metadata)
by_author = defaultdict(list)
for story in stories:
    author = story.get("author", "Unknown")
    by_author[author].append(story)

# Print summary per developer
for author, author_stories in by_author.items():
    print(f"\n## {author}")
    print(f"Total stories: {len(author_stories)}\n")
    for story in author_stories[:5]:  # Top 5
        print(f"- {story['title']}")
```

Usage:
```bash
python developer-reports.py
```

## When NOT to Use Repr for Teams

**Not ideal for:**
- Real-time project tracking (use Jira/Linear for that)
- Detailed task management (repr works at the story level, not task level)
- Sprint planning (repr reflects what happened, not what's planned)
- Time tracking (repr doesn't track hours)

**Ideal for:**
- Post-sprint summaries
- Performance reviews
- Stakeholder updates
- Retro preparation
- Release notes

Repr is a **reflection tool**, not a project management tool.

## What's Next?

Once your team is using repr:

- **Standardize exports**: Create templates for weekly updates, sprint summaries
- **Automate**: Set up CI/CD to generate changelogs on release
- **Share workflows**: Document your team's repr workflows in your internal wiki

Repr scales from individual developers to entire engineering organizations. Start small, expand as you find value.
