repr was built for developers who work on sensitive code. Whether you're in defense, healthcare, finance, or building a stealth startup—your code can't leave your machine.

This guide covers enterprise deployment, compliance requirements, and maximum-security configurations.

## Security Guarantees

### What repr Never Does

- ✗ Make background network calls
- ✗ Send telemetry or analytics
- ✗ Store API keys in config files
- ✗ Upload code without explicit user action
- ✗ Run daemons or background processes
- ✗ Access your source code (only reads git metadata)

### What repr Always Does

- ✓ Runs entirely locally by default
- ✓ Stores everything in `~/.repr/` on your machine
- ✓ Uses OS keychain for sensitive data (API keys)
- ✓ Provides audit logs of all network activity
- ✓ Allows permanent local-only lock
- ✓ Works in fully air-gapped environments

## Air-Gapped Deployment

For classified, restricted, or fully offline environments.

### Installation in Air-Gapped Environments

**Step 1: Download on internet-connected machine**

```bash
# On a machine with internet access
curl -L https://github.com/repr-app/cli/releases/latest/download/repr-linux.tar.gz -o repr.tar.gz

# Or for macOS
curl -L https://github.com/repr-app/cli/releases/latest/download/repr-macos.tar.gz -o repr.tar.gz
```

**Step 2: Transfer to air-gapped machine**

Use approved transfer methods (USB drive, secure file transfer, etc.)

**Step 3: Install on air-gapped machine**

```bash
tar -xzf repr-linux.tar.gz
sudo mv repr /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/repr
```

**Step 4: Install local LLM (Ollama)**

Download Ollama and model weights on internet-connected machine:

```bash
# Download Ollama installer
curl -L https://ollama.com/download/ollama-linux-amd64 -o ollama

# Download model weights
ollama pull llama3.2
# Model files are stored in ~/.ollama/models/
tar -czf ollama-models.tar.gz ~/.ollama/
```

Transfer `ollama` binary and `ollama-models.tar.gz` to air-gapped machine, then:

```bash
# Install Ollama
sudo mv ollama /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ollama

# Extract models
tar -xzf ollama-models.tar.gz -C ~/

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve &
```

**Step 5: Lock repr to local-only mode**

```bash
# Permanently disable cloud features
repr privacy lock-local --permanent

# Verify mode
repr mode
```

Output:
```text
Data boundary: local only (permanently locked)
Default inference: local

Local LLM: Ollama (llama3.2)

Available:
  ✓ Local generation
  ✗ Cloud generation (locked)
  ✗ Sync (locked)
  ✗ Publishing (locked)
```

**Step 6: Use normally**

```bash
repr init ~/code
repr generate --local
repr stories
```

### Network Verification

Verify that repr makes zero network calls:

```bash
# Monitor network activity
sudo tcpdump -i any -n host not 127.0.0.1 &

# Run repr
repr generate --local

# Verify: Should show NO packets from repr process
```

You can also use `strace` (Linux) or `dtrace` (macOS) to verify no network syscalls.

## Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA (Healthcare)

**Requirements:**
- ✅ No PHI leaves local machine
- ✅ Audit trail of all data access
- ✅ Encryption at rest

**repr Configuration:**

```bash
# Lock to local-only
repr privacy lock-local --permanent

# Use local LLM only
repr llm configure
# Select: Ollama (localhost)

# Enable audit logging
repr privacy audit --days 90 > compliance-audit.log
```

**Audit Trail:**

```bash
# Generate monthly audit report
repr privacy audit --days 30 --json > audit-$(date +%Y-%m).json
```

Output includes:
- All network operations (should be zero in local-only mode)
- All story generation events (local only)
- Data storage locations
- Privacy settings history

### SOX / PCI-DSS (Finance)

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Code doesn't leave secure environment
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs
- ✅ Access controls and audit trails

**repr Configuration:**

```bash
# Permanent local lock
repr privacy lock-local --permanent

# Verify privacy settings
repr privacy explain
```

**Data Redaction:**

repr automatically redacts:
- File paths (replaced with relative paths)
- Email addresses (commit authors)
- API keys and secrets (if accidentally committed)

To verify redaction:

```bash
# Generate stories and inspect
repr generate --local
repr story view <id>
# Check that absolute paths are redacted
```

### ITAR / Defense (Classified Environments)

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Zero external network access
- ✅ Code remains on classified system
- ✅ Auditable operations

**repr Configuration:**

```bash
# Install in air-gapped environment (see above)
repr privacy lock-local --permanent

# Verify zero network capability
repr mode
repr privacy explain
```

**Security Audit Checklist:**

- [ ] Binary installed via approved transfer method (USB)
- [ ] No internet connectivity on target system
- [ ] Local LLM installed and verified
- [ ] `repr privacy lock-local --permanent` executed
- [ ] Network monitoring shows zero external packets
- [ ] Stories stored only in `~/.repr/` (no external storage)
- [ ] All operations logged for audit

### GDPR (EU Data Protection)

**Requirements:**
- ✅ User consent for data processing
- ✅ Right to be forgotten
- ✅ Data portability

**repr Compliance:**

repr is GDPR-compliant by default:

1. **Consent:** repr never uploads data without explicit user action (`repr push`)
2. **Right to be forgotten:** Delete local stories with `repr story delete <id>`
3. **Data portability:** Export all data with `repr data backup`

```bash
# Export all your data (portable format)
repr data backup --output my-data.json

# Delete specific stories
repr story delete <id>

# Audit what (if anything) was sent to cloud
repr privacy audit --days 365
```

## Enterprise Features

### Multi-User Deployment

Deploy repr for your entire engineering team:

**1. Create standard configuration**

```bash
# Create ~/.repr/config.json template
{
  "llm": {
    "default": "local",
    "local_api_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
    "local_model": "llama3.2"
  },
  "privacy": {
    "lock_local_only": true,
    "lock_permanent": false,
    "telemetry_enabled": false
  },
  "generation": {
    "max_commits_per_batch": 50,
    "token_limit": 100000
  }
}
```

**2. Distribute to team**

```bash
# Package repr with config
tar -czf repr-enterprise.tar.gz repr config.json

# Distribute via your deployment system
# Each developer extracts and runs:
repr init ~/code
```

**3. Team workflow**

```bash
# Each developer uses repr locally
repr hooks install --all
repr generate --local

# For team summaries (managers)
repr repos add ~/code/team-project
repr generate --template changelog --since "2 weeks ago"
repr profile export --format md > sprint-summary.md
```

### Centralized LLM Deployment

Run one shared Ollama instance for your team (reduces resource usage):

**Server setup:**

```bash
# On a central server
ollama serve --host 0.0.0.0:11434

# Allow firewall access for your team
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/8 to any port 11434
```

**Client configuration:**

```bash
# Each developer configures repr to use central server
repr config set llm.local_api_url http://llm-server.company.local:11434/v1
repr config set llm.local_model llama3.2
```

**Privacy note:** This is still "local" in that your diffs go to your company's server, not a third party.

### Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

Coming soon: repr.dev cloud features will support SSO via:
- SAML 2.0
- OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub, Okta)
- OpenID Connect

In the meantime, use local-only mode for full control:

```bash
repr privacy lock-local
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Verify Binaries

Always verify repr binary authenticity:

```bash
# Download binary and signature
curl -L https://github.com/repr-app/cli/releases/latest/download/repr-linux.tar.gz -o repr.tar.gz
curl -L https://github.com/repr-app/cli/releases/latest/download/repr-linux.tar.gz.sha256 -o repr.sha256

# Verify checksum
sha256sum -c repr.sha256
```

### 2. Isolate repr Storage

Keep repr data separate from your code:

```bash
# repr stores everything in ~/.repr/ by default
# Optionally: mount ~/.repr/ on encrypted volume
# or set XDG_DATA_HOME to control location
```

### 3. Backup Regularly

repr stories are valuable. Back them up:

```bash
# Manual backup
repr data backup --output ~/backups/repr-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Automated backup (cron)
0 0 * * 0 repr data backup --output ~/backups/repr-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).json
```

### 4. Review Generated Content

Always review stories before publishing:

```bash
# Use dry-run before pushing to cloud
repr push --dry-run

# Review stories interactively
repr review
```

### 5. Rotate API Keys

If using BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):

```bash
# Remove old key
repr llm remove openai

# Add new key
repr llm add openai
```

Keys are stored in your OS keychain and encrypted by the OS.

## Troubleshooting Security Issues

### "Firewall blocked repr"

repr should work behind corporate firewalls if you're using local-only mode:

```bash
# Verify local-only mode
repr mode

# If using cloud features, you'll need to whitelist:
# - api.repr.dev (HTTPS)
# - auth.repr.dev (HTTPS)
```

### "Security scan flagged repr binary"

repr is open source. Your security team can:

1. Review source code: https://github.com/repr-app/cli
2. Build from source instead of using pre-built binaries
3. Run security scans on the binary

If your security team has concerns, open an issue: https://github.com/repr-app/cli/issues

### "Ollama using too much memory"

Ollama loads the entire model into RAM. For resource-constrained environments:

```bash
# Use smaller models
ollama pull phi3  # 2GB instead of 4GB

# Or use BYOK with external API
repr llm add openai
repr llm use byok:openai
```
